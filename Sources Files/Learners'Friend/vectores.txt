A quantity or phenomenon that has two independent properties, magnitude and direction, is called vector. 
The term has both the mathematical or geometrical importance of such a quantity.It is typically 
represented by an arrow whose direction is the same as that of the quantity and whose length is
proportional to the quantity’s magnitude.
Some Example of vector quantity are displacements, velocity, acceleration, momentum, force etc. 
The quantity which has only magnitude is called scalar. Some scalar quantity are distance, mass, 
time, frequency, wavelength etc.
Vectors can be depicted graphically in two or three dimensions. Magnitude is shown as the length of
a line segment. Direction is shown by the orientation of the line segment, and by an arrow at one end.
